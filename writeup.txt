Homework 5 One line scrabble

I was able to implement
- Board
- Tile Rack
- Individual Tiles from the JSON file and Scrabble Tiles folder
- Scoring including double word and double letter
- Shuffling of the tiles not on the Board
- Clearing tiles off the Board
- Getting brand new tiles to restart the game
- Lock out on trying to move tiles that were already placed
- Checking for adjacent tiles to ensure tiles cant be placed anywhere but next to existing tiles
- Blocking tiles from being placed in the same place

I was unable to implement
- Allowing for the user to move a tile already placed without majorly destroying the scoring
- Checks for real life words
- If i had more than one double word score there may be bugs (will be bugs)
- Moving tiles back to the rack manually
- It's not very pretty
